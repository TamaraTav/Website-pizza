                Things you must know about pizza
            </h1>
            <p>
                The story of pizza is a long one. From the Greeks
                to the Egyptians, from the Persians to the Indians,
                there have been incarnations of pizza served throughout
                history. Flatbreads, naan, and plakountos are all early
                preparations that could be considered cousins to the modern
                pizza, but there isnâ€™t a consensus as to which is first and
                whether these could even be considered precursors to pizza at
                all.
